  How to deploy a React app with Express on Azure(Gov)
</h1>

Kick off your project with Gatsby (makes life easy). This Repo exists to help you with the medium guide I posted 'How to deploy a React app with Express on Azure(Gov)'.


## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Setup**

    ```shell
    # Clone and install
    git clone https://github.com/ba5eem/unclouded.git
    cd unclouded/
    yarn install
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**


    ```shell
    cd unclouded/
    yarn start
    ```
3.  **Build and Run**


    ```shell
    cd unclouded/
    mv .env.example .env
    yarn build
    yarn start-api
    ```

4.  **Open the browser and check it out**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8080`!



## üßê What's inside?

Files inside to make getting started a little easier



1.  **`/server/index.js`**: This files is the entry file for the express server

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the front end code - I did not modify any of this. It was created with the Gatsby tool
